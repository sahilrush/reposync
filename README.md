This application is designed to fetch the top 10 latest commits from a GitHub repository. After retrieving the commits, an AI model summarizes them to provide a concise overview. Additionally, the application allows users to search for where these commits are used, where they exist, and the reasons behind the changes. For this functionality, LangChain has been used to process and analyze the commit data effectively.
